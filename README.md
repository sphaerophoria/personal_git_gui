# Personal git gui (name TBD)

I've tried a lot of git guis, and none of them have behaved the way I want. I
can't really put a good finger on it, but it feels like I want a different set
of features than most

This git gui is a gui tailored to me and my workflow. Eventual desired features
include...

* Fast
* Responsive to changes made from the command line or other tools
    * Maybe even with first class command line support baked in
* History centric view. Viewing history and filtering for different areas of
  interest should be fast and easy
* Submodule aware
* First class rebase support with the ability to keep multiple branches in sync
  with eachother
* GUI and TUI, maybe even cmdline
